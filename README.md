# Shared Pointers

Shared Pointers is a personal exploration and recreation of C++ shared pointers. This program demos the capabilities of my personal shared pointers.

## Running the Shared Pointers

Open a command line prompt at the directory containing main.cpp. Run the following command, substituting in your own file name for name-you-want-to-give:

```bash
g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> source.cpp
```
Run the program using the command:
```bash
./name-you-want-to-give
```
